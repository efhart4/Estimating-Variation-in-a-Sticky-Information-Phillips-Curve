# Time Variation in the Sticky Information Phillips Curve

## Overview
This repository contains the files and data related to the research paper titled "Time Variation in the Sticky Information Phillips Curve." The paper explores the dynamics of inflation using a Sticky Information Phillips Curve (SIPC).

## Research Paper
1. **Time Variation in the Sticky Information Phillips Curve.pdf**: This is the main research paper in PDF format. It contains detailed findings, analysis, and conclusions regarding the time variation in the SIPC.

## R Scripts for Estimation
1. **Metropolis Hasting Sampler.R**: This R script utilizes the Metropolis-Hastings Sampler to estimate the parameters of both fixed and time-varying models. It employs a joint likelihood approach to account for an endogenous variable.
2. **Analyze Samples.R**: This R script file contains the code used for the analysis of the data. It includes functions and routines for processing and analyzing the estimations produced by `Estimating Fixed and Time Varying Parameters.R`.
3. **Bayesian Model Comparison.R**: This R script performs Bayesian Model Comparison to find the marginal likelihood of each model and calculate the relative probability of each model.

## Data
1. **MyData.Rda**: This R data file contains the processed data used in the analysis.
